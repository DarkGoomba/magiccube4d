This is a program for people interested in higher dimensional analogues of Rubik style puzzles.  The origins lie with the developers [Melinda Green](http://www.superliminal.com/melinda/greenres.htm) and [Don Hatch](http://www.plunk.org/~hatch/), and it is a natural extension of their 4D analogue of Rubik's Cube, MagicCube4D.  The generic program simulates the projection of a number of 4D permutation puzzles into 3D space, which is rendered on the user's screen. The [MagicCube4D web site](http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm) offers detailed information about the program and links to other related resources.  The [4D Cubing Group](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/4D_Cubing/) is a forum for discussion.
